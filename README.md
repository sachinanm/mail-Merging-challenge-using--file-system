# Mail Merge Script with Python


**Generate personalized letters with ease using this Python mail merge script!**

## How it works

1. The script reads a list of names from the file `invited_names.txt` located in the `./Input/Names/` directory.
2. It then loads the content of the letter template from `starting_letter.txt` in the `./Input/Letters/` directory.
3. For each name in the list, it replaces the placeholder `[name]` in the letter template with the current name.
4. The personalized letter is saved in the `./Output/ReadyToSend/` directory with the filename `letter_for_[name].txt`.

## üåü Learning

This project is an excellent learning exercise for beginners to Python programming. By working on this script, you can gain experience in the following areas:

- **File Handling:** You'll learn how to read from and write to files using Python, which is a fundamental skill for working with various data formats.

- **String Manipulation:** The script utilizes string manipulation techniques to replace the placeholder in the letter template with each name from the list.

- **Loops and Iteration:** You'll understand the concept of loops and iteration by processing each name in the list and creating a personalized letter for each recipient.

- **Python Libraries:** The script demonstrates how to use standard Python libraries for file handling and string operations.

- **Project Organization:** You'll learn how to structure a small project with different directories to keep the code organized and maintainable.
